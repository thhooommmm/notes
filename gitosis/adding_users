Adding users

The next natural thing to do is to grant some lucky few commit access to the
FreeMonkey project. This is a simple two step process.

First, gather their public SSH keys, which I'll call "alice.pub" and "bob.pub",
and drop them into keydir/ of your local gitosis-admin repository. Second, edit
gitosis.conf and add them to the "members" list.

cd gitosis-admin
cp ~/alice.pub keydir/
cp ~/bob.pub keydir/
git add keydir/alice.pub keydir/bob.pub

Note that the key filename must have a ".pub" extension.

gitosis.conf changes:

 [group myteam]
 - members = jdoe
 + members = jdoe alice bob
   writable = free_monkey

   Commit and push:

   git commit -a -m "Granted Alice and Bob commit rights to FreeMonkey"
   git push

   That's it. Alice and Bob can now clone the free_monkey repository like so:

   git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git

   Alice and Bob will also have commit rights.
