Non-standard SSH port

If you run SSH on a non-standard port on your server, don't use the syntax
"git@myserver.com:1234:/foo/bar", it won't work. Putting the port in the URL
doesn't seem to make gitosis, or git, (not sure which) happy. Instead, put this
in your ~/.ssh/config file:

Host myserver.com
  Port 1234
